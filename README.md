# AI-Automation-Projects-with-Smart-Workflows
# 📦 AI-Powered Inventory Management Agent

This is a basic AI + automation project I built to explore how no-code tools and AI can simplify everyday tasks — like managing stock data.

## 🚀 What It Does

This lightweight agent automates inventory updates by connecting:
- 🧠 **Gemini API** – for intelligent decision-making  
- 🔁 **n8n** – for workflow automation  
- 📊 **Google Sheets** – as the live inventory database

### ✅ Core Features
- Reads inventory data from Google Sheets
- Automatically updates stock status
- Deletes items marked as out of stock
- Uses Gemini prompts to suggest or perform basic actions

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [Gemini API (Free Tier)](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/)
- [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/)
- Google Sheets

## 🔍 Why I Built This

I kept seeing people experiment with AI agents and no-code automation, so I decided to give it a try myself.  
This project helped me understand how accessible and powerful these tools can be — even for small, real-world problems.

## 📬 What’s Next?

I’m exploring how to expand this project with:
- Telegram alerts for real-time stock notifications  
- Email reports  
- Voice command integration

## ⚡ Upcoming Projects
This is just the beginning — more AI + automation mini-projects are on the way!
